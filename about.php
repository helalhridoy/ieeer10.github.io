          Applications and Systems (COMPAS 2023)</h1>
        <h3 style="color: brown;">Date: November 25-26, 2023</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 16px;">IEEE Computer Society R10 comprises more than 40
          chapters. For increasing the collaborations among these chapters a flagship conference of IEEE CS R10 that
          will be hosted at different countries in a rotation basis can be very much helpful. Considering this fact IEEE
          CS R10 is going to organize 1st R10CS International Conference on Computing and Information Technology (R10CIT
          2023) on November 25-26, 2023 to be held at Dhaka, Bangladesh. R10CIT is going to be an excellent platform for
          the students, academicians, and professionals of ICT, CSE, EEE and allied fields from various universities,
          research institutes, and industries to share their ideas, discuss recent developments and research with
          eminent researchers and academicians. Researchers will get an opportunity to publish their research outcomes
          at the proceedings of R10CIT that will be included at IEEE Xplore and will be indexed by Scopus and other
          indexing services.</p>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 16px;">The CS Flagship conference will become an iconic and
          unique event of the R10 that will gather
          dynamic researchers, academicians, graduate student, think tanks and industry experts from parts
          of the world under one roof. We would like to invite you to join us, the worldâ€™s most excellent
          opportunity for reporting scientific breakthroughs in the areas related to the conference theme.
